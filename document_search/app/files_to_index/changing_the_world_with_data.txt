It starts with a feeling
Decide on an issue you feel you have to work on,

for me this was ending slavery.
Finding your people
You can't solve anything on your own.

You need a group of people with you.

We have power in numbers and to keep

The work from burning any one person out.
Build a thing

                 &&
                Results
Find people effected by the issue you care about
Get their feedback and iterate

on your system with them in mind.
Take your thing on the road
Once I iterated I actually was able to

Build a system that helped people

Stay connected with those across the country
Once you build a system that really works

It's easy to make more

See the change in the world
Eventually, with enough effort you will get results, but it takes long term effort.

With the combined efforts of many people across the country, the cause to end slavery
has:

     Been able to put the CEO of backpage behind bars, sending a strong signal that
     trafficking has costs
     Been able to lift some victims out of slavery and find a better life
